            Experience the electric atmosphere at Elland Road as Leeds United orchestrated a remarkable 
            comeback to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat against Championship leaders Leicester.
                 Trailing 1-0, substitute Connor Roberts ignited the crowd with a crucial equalizer in the 
                 80th minute, setting the stage for teenage sensation Archie Gray to send the stadium into 
                 pandemonium with a deflected strike moments later. As Leicester lost their composure, 
                 Dan James sealed the win with a free-kick that ricocheted off Patrick Bamford and into the 
                 net in stoppage time. Despite Leicester's early dominance, Wout Faes' header gave them the 
                 lead, but controversy ensued as Patson Daka saw a goal wrongly disallowed for offside.
                  Daka's missed opportunity to extend the lead proved costly as Leeds capitalized on 
                  their chances, securing a ninth successive league win and closing the gap to six points
                   behind the league leaders. In a thrilling encounter filled with drama and excitement, 
                   Elland Road witnessed another memorable chapter in Leeds United's storied history.
